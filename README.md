# Activity Stream Examples 

The Activity Stream SDK is split up in to two components

* **[as-sdk](https://github.com/activitystream/as-sdk)** that contains core SDK files
* **as-sdk-examples** which contains reusable code and message examples (this)

Both of these can be cloned and extended and pull-requests are welcome.

**Please note:** The examples show one way to format AS events but that can be altered, extended or completely changed during any integration/implementation.  

### SDK Example Principles

* Examples are meant to be reusable (copied)
* Examples should rely on minimum number of dependencies
* All examples are developed as tests  

### Contact and support
* Feel free to create issues here or contact our [Integration Support team directly](mailto:integration-support@activitystream.com).

### Todo
 - [ ] Update the Examples with code from various integration efforts
 - [ ] Provide an example of all/most of the Predefined AS message Types (PAST). 
 - [ ] Document and index all examples
 - [ ] Clean up the project so that different languages have project files likely to useful for that language
